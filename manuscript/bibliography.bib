	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19225523},
	abstract = {The response of terrestrial vegetation to a globally changing environment is central to predictions of future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The role of tropical forests is critical because they are carbon-dense and highly productive. Inventory plots across Amazonia show that old-growth forests have increased in carbon storage over recent decades, but the response of one-third of the world's tropical forests in Africa is largely unknown owing to an absence of spatially extensive observation networks. Here we report data from a ten-country network of long-term monitoring plots in African tropical forests. We find that across 79 plots (163 ha) above-ground carbon storage in live trees increased by 0.63 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) between 1968 and 2007 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.22-0.94; mean interval, 1987-96). Extrapolation to unmeasured forest components (live roots, small trees, necromass) and scaling to the continent implies a total increase in carbon storage in African tropical forest trees of 0.34 Pg C yr(-1) (CI, 0.15-0.43). These reported changes in carbon storage are similar to those reported for Amazonian forests per unit area, providing evidence that increasing carbon storage in old-growth forests is a pan-tropical phenomenon. Indeed, combining all standardized inventory data from this study and from tropical America and Asia together yields a comparable figure of 0.49 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (n = 156; 562 ha; CI, 0.29-0.66; mean interval, 1987-97). This indicates a carbon sink of 1.3 Pg C yr(-1) (CI, 0.8-1.6) across all tropical forests during recent decades. Taxon-specific analyses of African inventory and other data suggest that widespread changes in resource availability, such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, may be the cause of the increase in carbon stocks, as some theory and models predict.},

The best available tree height-diameter relationships derived for Central Africa do not render accurate canopy height estimates for our study area. Aboveground carbon stocks would be overestimated by 24\% if these inaccurate relationships were used. The studied forests have a lower stature compared with forests in the outer regions of the basin, which confirms remotely sensed patterns.

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22645827},
	abstract = {Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in efforts to combat climate change requires participating countries to periodically assess their forest resources on a national scale. Such a process is particularly challenging in the tropics because of technical difficulties related to large aboveground forest biomass stocks, restricted availability of affordable, appropriate remote-sensing images, and a lack of accurate forest inventory data. In this paper, we apply the Fourier-based FOTO method of canopy texture analysis to Google Earth's very-high-resolution images of the wet evergreen forests in the Western Ghats of India in order to (1) assess the predictive power of the method on aboveground biomass of tropical forests, (2) test the merits of free Google Earth images relative to their native commercial IKONOS counterparts and (3) highlight further research needs for affordable, accurate regional aboveground biomass estimations. We used the FOTO method to ordinate Fourier spectra of 1436 square canopy images (125 x 125 m) with respect to a canopy grain texture gradient (i.e., a combination of size distribution and spatial pattern of tree crowns), benchmarked against virtual canopy scenes simulated from a set of known forest structure parameters and a 3-D light interception model. We then used 15 1-ha ground plots to demonstrate that both texture gradients provided by Google Earth and IKONOS images strongly correlated with field-observed stand structure parameters such as the density of large trees, total basal area, and aboveground biomass estimated from a regional allometric model. Our results highlight the great potential of the FOTO method applied to Google Earth data for biomass retrieval because the texture-biomass relationship is only subject to 15\% relative error, on average, and does not show obvious saturation trends at large biomass values. We also provide the first reliable map of tropical forest aboveground biomass predicted from free Google Earth images.},

	abstract = {For the past century, woody plants have increased in grasslands and savannas worldwide. Woody encroachment may signiﬁcantly alter ecosystem functioning including ﬁre regimes, herbivore carrying capacity, biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. Traditionally, increases in woody cover and density have been ascribed to changes in the disturbance regime (ﬁre and herbivores) or rainfall. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations may also contribute, by increasing growth rates of trees relative to grasses. This hypothesis is still heavily debated because usually potential CO2 effects are confounded by changes in land use (disturbance regime). Here we analyse changes in woody density in ﬁre experiments at three sites in South African savannas where the disturbance regime (ﬁre and herbivores) was kept constant for 30 and 50 years. If global drivers had signiﬁcant effects on woody plants, we would expect signiﬁcant increases in tree densities and biomass over time under the constant disturbance regime. Woody density remained constant in a semiarid savanna but tripled in a mesic savanna between the 1970s and 1990s. At the third site, a semiarid savanna near the southern limits of the biome, tree density doubled from the mid 1990s to 2010. Interpretation of the causes is confounded by population recovery after clearing, but aerial photograph analysis on adjacent non-cleared areas showed an accompanying 48\% increase in woody cover. Increased CO2 concentrations are consistent with increased woody density while other global drivers (rainfall) remained constant over the duration of the experiments. The absence of a response in one semiarid savanna could be explained by a smaller carbon sink capacity of the dominant species, which would therefore beneﬁt less from increased CO2. Understanding how savannas and grasslands respond to increased CO2 and identifying the causes of woody encroachment are essential for the successful management of these systems.},

	abstract = {Agricultural expansion has resulted in both land use and land cover change (LULCC) across the tropics. However, the spatial and temporal patterns of such change and their resulting impacts are poorly understood, particularly for the presatellite era. Here, we quantify the LULCC history across the 33.9 million ha watershed of Tanzania’s Eastern Arc Mountains, using geo-referenced and digitized historical land cover maps (dated 1908, 1923, 1949 and 2000). Our time series from this biodiversity hotspot shows that forest and savanna area both declined, by 74\% (2.8 million ha) and 10\% (2.9 million ha), respectively, between 1908 and 2000. This vegetation was replaced by a ﬁvefold increase in cropland, from 1.2 million ha to 6.7 million ha. This LULCC implies a committed release of 0.9 Pg C (95\% CI: 0.4–1.5) across the watershed for the same period, equivalent to 0.3 Mg C haÀ1 yrÀ1. This is at least threefold higher than previous estimates from global models for the same study area. We then used the LULCC data from before and after protected area creation, as well as from areas where no protection was established, to analyse the effectiveness of legal protection on land cover change despite the underlying spatial variation in protected areas. We found that, between 1949 and 2000, forest expanded within legally protected areas, resulting in carbon uptake of 4.8 (3.8–5.7) Mg C haÀ1, compared to a committed loss of 11.9 (7.2–16.6) Mg C haÀ1 within areas lacking such protection. Furthermore, for nine protected areas where LULCC data are available prior to and following establishment, we show that protection reduces deforestation rates by 150\% relative to unprotected portions of the watershed. Our results highlight that considerable LULCC occurred prior to the satellite era, thus other data sources are required to better understand long-term land cover trends in the tropics.},

The study was based on remotely sensed data covering a Norwegian protected cultural environment consisting of several pebble-stone built grave cairns. Georeferenced digital elevation models (DEMs) were generated using historical air photographs from the years 1968, 1979 and 1999. In addition ALS datasets from 2008 and 2010 were used in the study. Altogether seven difference models were generated as a result of conducting automated change detections between the different epochs. In this way detailed information about changes that occurred in the landscape and to individual monuments for almost the last 50 years was obtained. Further, the incidents that caused the identiﬁed changes were interpreted based on documents from archives. Using this approach the dynamic character of the studied protected site was proven. The study demonstrates the importance of historical aerial photographs as a valuable source that makes possible retrospective monitoring of past landscape changes on a detailed scale.},

We investigated the sources and implications of georectification error in the measurement of lateral channel movement by testing how the number (6–30) and type (human versus natural landscape features) of ground-control points (GCPs) and the order of the transformation polynomial (first-, second-, and third-order) affected the spatial accuracy of a typical georectified aerial photograph. Error was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the GCPs as well as error in 31 independent test points. The RMSE and the mean and median values of test-point errors were relatively insensitive to the number of GCPs above eight, but the upper range of test-point errors showed marked improvement (i.e., the number of extreme errors was reduced) as more GCPs were used for georectification. Using more GCPs thus improved overall georectification accuracy, but this improvement was not indicated by the RMSE, suggesting that independent test-points located in key areas of interest should be used in addition to RSME to evaluate georectification error.},

Historically, such information was often acquired through manual interpretation of aerial photographs. As traditional methods of analyzing aerial photographs can be time-consuming, subjective, and can require well-trained interpreters (who are currently in short supply), new approaches must be explored for collecting this ecological information. First, we discuss the benefits and challenges of using aerial photographs for ecological management. We then examine the eight fundamental characteristics used in photograph interpretation and discuss their ecological relevance. Third, we investigate the feasibility of digitalanalysis methods (often used for analysis of satellite imagery) for providing more objective, consistent, and cost-effective results. We end with several examples of how the unique information from aerial photographs can aid in solutions to emerging challenges in ecological research and management, and how they may be further used with supplementary data sets.},

The study site is located in the northwest part of Burkina Faso (West Africa), and features a plain with a savanna physiognomy and gentle slopes covered by tiger bush. Digitized data (pixel size of 3.15 m) covered a belt transect of 9 km by 1.5 km that has been divided into 315 m2 square quadrats. Four reference quadrats were digitized with a pixel of 0.83 m, for comparison with high-resolution outlooks from 1994. Pattern quantication relied on spectral analysis by Fourier transform, that yielded dominant wavelengths (radial spectrum) and main orientations (angular spectrum). The vegetation in the plain displayed important changes that were related to the collapse of the herbaceous cover (and associated scattered trees), and its partial post-drought recovery. Such changes were quanti ed as a relative decline of small spatial wavelengths ({\textless}40 m), followed by a bounce-back of wavelengths in the range 25–50 m. An underlying pattern of fragmented bands of woodland was also revealed with a dominant orientation and a characteristic wavelength ranging from 80 m up to more than 105 m. On the gentle slopes, dense wooded bands that constituted tiger bush (with a wavelength in the range 60–80 m) displayed only minor changes through time. Spectral analysis by Fourier transform proved to be a suitable way to monitoring patterned semi-arid vegetation for which periodicity and orientation are important characteristics. Consistent diachronic comparisons are possible even with historical photographs of varying scale and quality.},

	abstract = {The aerial photographs (APs) acquired by the Istituto Geograﬁco Militare (IGM) in the period of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1935–1941) have recently been discovered, scanned and organised. Until recently, the oldest APs of the country that were available had been taken in the period 1958–1964. The APs over Ethiopia in 1935–1941 consist of 8281 assemblages on approximately 50 cm × 20 cm hardboard tiles, each holding a label, one nadir-pointing photograph ﬂanked by two low-oblique photographs and one high-oblique photograph. The four APs were exposed simultaneously and were taken across the ﬂight line. The high-oblique photograph is presented alternatively at left and at right. There is approximately 60\% overlap between subsequent sets of APs. One of Santoni’s glass plate multi-cameras was used, with focal length of 178 mm and with a ﬂight height of 4000–4500 m a.s.l., which resulted in an approximate scale of 1:11,500 for the central photograph and 1:16,000 to 1:18,000 for the low-oblique APs. The surveyors oriented themselves with maps of Ethiopia at 1:400,000 scale, compiled in 1934. The ﬂights present a dense AP coverage of Northern Ethiopia, where they were acquired in the context of upcoming battles with the Ethiopian army. Several ﬂights preceded the later advance of the Italian army southwards to the capital Addis Ababa. Further ﬂights took place in central Ethiopia for civilian purposes. As of 1936, the APs were used to prepare topographic maps at 1:100,000 and 1:50,000 scales. To re-process the imagery using novel techniques, procedures using digital image-based modelling have been developed. The 1935-1941 APs together with those of 1958–1964, 1994 and recent high-resolution satellite imagery are currently being used in spatio-temporal analysis, including change studies of land cover, land management and geomorphology in Ethiopia over a time span of 80 years.},

	abstract = {Understanding of the relative contribution of bank erosion to sediment budgets in New Zealand is limited. Few measurements of bank erosion rates exist, and this is a major limitation to the development of a locally calibrated model of bank erosion. The New Zealand sediment budget model, SedNetNZ, predicts bank erosion based on preliminary data, and this study aims to underpin the development of an improved model for bank erosion. Photogrammetric techniques and LiDAR were used to collect data on bank erosion rates for ﬁve different river reaches, ranging from 3 to 14 km in length, in the Kaipara Catchment, Northland, New Zealand. Changing river channel planform between the 1950s and 2015 was assessed using four to ﬁve well-spaced dates of historical aerial photographs. Changes in planform were combined with bank height, to calculate erosion and accretion volumes which were compared with SedNetNZ modelled estimates. Erosion and accretion is relatively evenly balanced in the study sites. The largest difference in terms of relative proportions of erosion and accretion are found along the Tangowahine River (13.4 km reach length), where 492,000 m3 of sediment eroded between 1956 and 2015 compared to 364,000 m3 of accretion. Lateral migration rates (erosion) for the ﬁve river reaches range between 0.14 m yr−1 and 0.21 m yr−1 and are comparable with those measured by previous assessments in New Zealand. The migration rates in channel widths per year for the three larger rivers (stream order 5–6) range between 0.4\% and 0.8\% of channel width per year. In contrast, the smaller streams (stream order 3–4) are retreating more rapidly, with width-averaged rates of 1.7\% and 3.0\%. Current SedNetNZ modelling tends to underestimate the bank height and greatly overestimates the migration rate.},

	abstract = {Wars have major economic, political and human implications, and they can strongly aﬀect environment and land use, not only during the conﬂicts, but also afterwards. However, data on the land use eﬀects of wars is sparse, especially for World War II, the largest war in history. Our goal was to quantify and understand the time-lagged land use eﬀects of WWII in Romania, by applying Structure from Motion technology to 1960s Corona spy satellite photography. We quantiﬁed forest cutting across Romania from 1955 to 1965. This was a period when Romania's economy recovered from the war and when Romania established close economic ties to the Soviet Union, and when the Romanian government made reparation payments to the Soviet Union. To understand the eﬀects of war, we developed an accurate and fast method to orthorectify high-resolution Corona photography in mountain areas, and rectiﬁed scanned Corona photography based on Structure from Motion technology. Our study area of 212,000 km2 was covered by 208 Corona ﬁlm strips, which we rectiﬁed with an overall average accuracy of 14.3 m. We identiﬁed 530,000 ha of forest cuts over this time period, the rate of which is three times higher than contemporary cutting rates. Our results highlight that the environmental and land use eﬀects of WWII were substantial in Romania, due to reparation payments, post-war policies regarding resource exploitation, and technological and infrastructural development. Our research provides quantitative evidence of how wars can cause time-lagged and long-term eﬀects on the environment. Methodologically, we advance remote sensing science by pioneering a new approach to orthorectify Corona photography for large areas eﬀectively. Corona data are available globally. Our approach facilitates the extension of the data record of space borne observation of the earth by one to two decades earlier than what is possible with satellite datasets.},

	abstract = {Increased resolution and availability of remote sensing products, and advancements in small-scale aerial drone systems, allows observations of glacial changes at unprecedented levels of detail. Software developments, such as structurefrom-motion (SfM), now allow users an easy and efficient method to generate three-dimensional (3D) models and orthoimages from aerial or terrestrial datasets. While these advancements show promise for current and future glacier monitoring, many regions still suffer a lack of observations from earlier time periods. We report on the use of SfM to extract spatial information from various historic imagery sources. We focus on three geographic regions, the European Alps, high Arctic Norway and the Nepal Himalayas. We used terrestrial field photographs from 1896, high oblique aerial photographs from 1936 and aerial handheld photographs from 1978 to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos of the Rhone glacier, Brøggerhalvøya and the lower Khumbu glacier, respectively. Our analysis shows that applying SfM to historic imagery can generate high quality models using only ground control points. Limited camera/orientation information was largely reproduced using self-calibrated model data. Using these data, we calculated mean ground sampling distances across each site which demonstrates the high potential resolution of resulting models. Vertical errors for our models are ±5.4 m, ±5.2 m and ±3.3 m. Differencing shows similar patterns of thinning at lower Rhone (European Alps) and Brøggerhalvøya (Norway) glaciers, which have mean thinning rates of 0.31 m aÀ1 (1896–2010) to 0.86 m aÀ1 (1936–2010) respectively. On these clean ice glaciers thinning is highest in the terminus region and decreasing up-glacier. In contrast to these glaciers, uneven topography, exposed ice-cliffs and debris cover on the Khumbu glacier create a highly variable spatial distribution of thinning. The mean thinning rate for the Khumbu study area was found to be 0.54 ± 0.9 m aÀ1 (1978–2015). Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Methods: We collected vegetation data from two old-growth S. robusta forest stands. We sampled 128 plots of 100 m2 equally spread between the two habitats: gap and closed canopy. In each plot, we recorded the total number of woody species, number of individuals of seedlings and saplings of tree species and measured the DBH of all saplings. We compared species richness and composition of total woody species, seedlings and saplings between the two habitats. We used ordination to analyse species composition, and an individualbased species accumulation curves to illustrate the effect of density on species richness.
Results: The species composition of total woody species and seedlings was similar in both habitats, but species composition of saplings differed between habitats. Total woody and seedling richness were similar between habitats at one site, but were richer under closed canopy at the other site. Sapling richness was higher in gaps at both sites and was a function of stem density at one site, but not at the other site.
Conclusions: Gaps are not always areas of higher woody species richness and therefore may be less important than expected for the overall species richness of woody plants. Instead, they are potentially important for enhancing local tree richness by increasing sapling richness. Gap disturbance is the primary driver of structural heterogeneity in forests where topographic and edaphic gradients are negligible.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests store vast amounts of carbon and are the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats, yet they are being converted and degraded at alarming rates. Given global shortfalls in the budgets required to prevent carbon and biodiversity loss, we need to seek solutions that simultaneously address both issues. Of particular interest are carbonbased payments under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism to also conserve biodiversity at no additional cost. One potential is for REDD+ to protect forest fragments, especially within biomes where contiguous forest cover has diminished dramatically, but we require empirical tests of the strength of any carbon and biodiversity cobeneﬁts in such fragmented systems. Using the globally threatened Atlantic Forest landscape, we measured above-ground carbon stocks within forest fragments spanning 13 to 23 442 ha in area and with different degrees of isolation. We related these stocks to tree community structure and to the richness and abundance of endemic and IUCN Red-listed species. We found that increasing fragment size has a positive relationship with above-ground carbon stock and with abundance of IUCN Red-listed species and tree community structure. We also found negative relationships between distance from large forest block and tree community structure, endemic species richness and abundance, and IUCN Red-listed species abundance. These resulted in positive congruence between carbon stocks and Red-listed species, and the abundance and richness of endemic species, demonstrating vital cobeneﬁts. As such, protecting forest fragments in hotspots of biodiversity, particularly larger fragments and those closest to sources, offers important carbon and biodiversity cobeneﬁts. More generally, our results suggest that macroscale models of cobeneﬁts under REDD+ have likely overlooked key beneﬁts at small scales, indicating the necessity to apply models that include ﬁner-grained assessments in fragmented landscapes rather than using averaged coarse-grained cells.},

	abstract = {The Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and Kenya are one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots. The Eastern Arc forests are, as are many other tropical biodiversity hotspots, highly fragmented. Understanding the impact of habitat fragmentation (i.e., habitat loss and subdivision) on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests is important because forest spatial structure highly influences species richness, persistence, and extinction debt. Here we examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on the spatial structure of the Eastern Arc forests at a patch scale using very high resolution aerial imagery having a spatial resolution of 0.5–1.5 m. Forest area across the 13 Eastern Arc Mountains is 405,852 ha and is distributed into 311 fragments ≥ 10 ha in size with a median fragment size of 84 ha. The 18 largest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains contain greater than three-quarters of total forest area. Average fragment isolation, as assessed by median distance to nearest fragment and median distance to the nearest larger fragment, is 867 and 1533 m, respectively. Of total forest area, 14\% is {\textless} 100 m from the forest edge and 33\% is {\textless} 300 m from the forest edge. Establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments through forest regeneration and protection of secondary regenerating forest as well as providing protected area status to the remaining non-protected forest including unprotected smaller forest fragments are important to enhancing the long-term persistence of many plant and animal species here.},

	abstract = {Light is the key energy input for all vegetated systems. Forest light regimes are complex, with the vertical pattern of light within canopies inﬂuenced by forest structure. Human disturbances in tropical forests impact forest structure and hence may inﬂuence the light environment and thus competitiveness of different trees. In this study, we measured vertical diffuse light proﬁles along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance, sampling intact, logged, secondary, and fragmented sites in the biodiversity hot spot of the Atlantic forest, southeast Brazil, using photosynthetically active radiation sensors and a novel approach with estimations of vertical light proﬁles from hemispherical photographs. Our results show clear differences in vertical light proﬁles with disturbance: Fragmented forests are characterized by rapid light extinction within their low canopies, while the proﬁles in logged forests show high heterogeneity and high light in the mid-canopy despite decades of recovery. The secondary forest showed similar light proﬁles to intact forest, but with a lower canopy height. We also show that in some cases the upper canopy layer and heavy liana infestations can severely limit light penetration. Light extinction with height above the ground and depth below the canopy top was highest in fragmented forest and negatively correlated with canopy height. The novel, inexpensive, and rapid methods described here can be applied to other sites to quantify rarely measured vertical light proﬁles.},

	abstract = {Earth system models predict a zonal dipole of precipitation change over tropical South America, with decreases over the Amazon and increases over the Andes. Much of this has been attributed to the physiological response of the rainforest to elevated CO2, which describes a basin-wide reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration. While robust in Earth system model experiments, details of the underlying atmospheric mechanism—specifically how it evolves in the context of land-atmosphere interaction and the diurnal cycle—are unresolved. We investigate this using idealized model simulations and find that within 24 hr of a CO2 increase, changes occur over the Amazon that engender synoptic timescale feedbacks. Decreased evapotranspiration from the rainforest throttles near-surface moisture, inducing a drier, warmer, and deeper boundary layer. Above this, enhanced turbulent diffusivity increases vapor in the lower free troposphere. Together, these processes reduce convective activity and cause immediate decreases in Amazon rainfall. Over the synoptic timescale, these changes leave behind lower tropospheric moisture, which is advected westward by the background jet and increases Andean precipitation. This produces a dipole of precipitation change consistent across global and regional models as well as parameterized and resolved convection, though details are sensitive to model topography and boundary layer formulation. The mechanism reported here stresses the importance of fast timescale processes affecting stability over a period of hours that can influence longer-term vegetation-climate interactions. These results help clarify the Amazon's physiological response to rising CO2 and provide insight into possible causes of historical model biases and end-of-century uncertainty in this region.},

We tested the hypothesis that canopy structure (leaf area and light availability) – remotely estimated from LiDAR – control variation in above-ground coarse wood production (biomass growth). Using a statistical model, these factors predicted biomass growth across tree size classes in forest near Manaus, Brazil. The same statistical model, with no parameterisation change but driven by different observed canopy structure, predicted the higher productivity of a site 500 km east. Gap fraction and a metric of vegetation vertical extent and evenness also predicted biomass gains and losses for one-hectare plots. Despite signiﬁcant site differences in canopy structure and carbon dynamics, the relation between biomass growth and light fell on a unifying curve. This supported our hypothesis, suggesting that knowledge of canopy structure can explain variation in biomass growth over tropical landscapes and improve understanding of ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation now constitutes an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Given growing concerns about global climate change, it is all the more important to identify cases in which economic growth has not sparked excessive forest clearance. We address the recent reduction of deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by conducting a statistical analysis to ascertain if different levels of environmental enforcement between two groups of municipalities had any impact on this reduction. Our analysis shows that these targeted, heightened enforcement efforts avoided as much as 10,653 km2 of deforestation, which translates into 1.44 × 10−1 Pg C in avoided emissions for the 3 y period. Moreover, most of the carbon loss and land conversion would have occurred at the expense of closed moist forests. Although such results are encouraging, we caution that signiﬁcant challenges remain for Brazil’s continued success in this regard, given recent changes in the forestry code, ongoing massive investments in hydro power generation, reductions of established protected areas, and growing demand for agricultural products.},

Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth-survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

Forest cover is interpreted from satellite imagery at 30 9 30 m resolution. Forest cover changes are then combined with pan-tropical biomass maps to estimate carbon losses. We show that there was a gross loss of tropical forests of 8.0 million ha yrÀ1 in the 1990s and 7.6 million ha yrÀ1 in the 2000s (0.49\% annual rate), with no statistically signiﬁcant difference. Humid forests account for 64\% of the total forest cover in 2010 and 54\% of the net forest loss during second study decade. Losses of forest cover and Other Wooded Land (OWL) cover result in estimates of carbon losses which are similar for 1990s and 2000s at 887 MtC yrÀ1 (range: 646–1238) and 880 MtC yrÀ1 (range: 602–1237) respectively, with humid regions contributing two-thirds. The estimates of forest area changes have small statistical standard errors due to large sample size. We also reduce uncertainties of previous estimates of carbon losses and removals. Our estimates of forest area change are signiﬁcantly lower as compared to national survey data. We reconcile recent low estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation for early 2000s and show that carbon loss rates did not change between the two last decades. Carbon losses from deforestation represent circa 10\% of Carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production during the last decade (2000–2010). Our estimates of annual removals of carbon from forest regrowth at 115 MtC yrÀ1 (range: 61–168) and 97 MtC yrÀ1 (53–141) for the 1990s and 2000s respectively are ﬁve to ﬁfteen times lower than earlier published estimates.},

	abstract = {Numerous authors have stressed the importance of guaranteeing and protecting the tenure and human rights of indigenous and other forest-based communities under schemes for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD, or REDD+); and important international indigenous organizations have spoken out strongly against REDD+. This article examines two speciﬁc issues that present risks for local communities: rights to forests and rules for resource use. It draws on the ﬁndings of a study conducted by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) on forest tenure reforms in selected countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America from 2006 to 2008. The study underlines the numerous obstacles faced by communities after rights are won, in moving from statutory rights to their implementation and to access to beneﬁts on the ground. It argues that there is currently little reason to expect better results from national policies under REDD+ without binding agreements to protect local rights.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests exhibit complex but poorly understood patterns of leaf phenology. Understanding species- and individual-level phenological patterns in tropical forests requires datasets covering large numbers of trees, which can be provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we test a workﬂow combining high-resolution RGB images (7 cm/pixel) acquired from UAVs with a machine learning algorithm to monitor tree and species leaf phenology in a tropical forest in Panama. We acquired images for 34 ﬂight dates over a 12-month period. Crown boundaries were digitized in images and linked with forest inventory data to identify species. We evaluated predictions of leaf cover from diﬀerent models that included up to 14 image features extracted for each crown on each date. The models were trained and tested with visual estimates of leaf cover from 2422 images from 85 crowns belonging to eight species spanning a range of phenological patterns. The best-performing model included both standard color metrics, as well as texture metrics that quantify within-crown variation, with r2 of 0.84 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.8\% in 10-fold cross-validation. In contrast, the model based only on the widely-used Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) index performed relatively poorly (r2 = 0.52, MAE = 13.6\%). These results highlight the utility of texture features for image analysis of tropical forest canopies, where illumination changes may diminish the utility of color indices, such as GCC. The algorithm successfully predicted both individual-tree and species patterns, with mean r2 of 0.82 and 0.89 and mean MAE of 8.1\% and 6.0\% for individual- and species-level analyses, respectively. Our study is the ﬁrst to develop and test methods for landscape-scale UAV monitoring of individual trees and species in diverse tropical forests. Our analyses revealed undescribed patterns of high intraspeciﬁc variation and complex leaf cover changes for some species.},

Comparison of aerial photographs from 1941 and 1994 had previously revealed a landscape-wide expansion of closed forest and contraction of grassland patches. Good congruence between ﬁeld measurements and the vegetation classiﬁcations from the 1994 aerial photography supported the authenticity of the vegetation changes. The relative abundance of rainforest and nonrainforest tree species also concurred with mapped vegetation transitions. Changes in individual size classes of rainforest species, which are relatively ﬁre sensitive, were consistent with the primacy of ﬁre in controlling the distribution of the closed-forest formation. Fire scars previously mapped from satellite imagery were used to derive a ﬁre activity index for contrasting vegetation transitions. Savannas that had converted to closed forest had lower ﬁre activity than did stable savannas. Conversely, closed forests that converted to savanna had the highest ﬁre activity index. The landscape-wide expansion of rainforest is associated with the cessation of Aboriginal ﬁre management, possibly in conjunction with elevated CO2 and increasing annual rainfall.},

	abstract = {Land-cover change detection using satellite remote sensing is largely conﬁned to the era of Landsat satellites, from 1972 to present. However, the Corona, Argon, and Lanyard intelligence satellites operated by the U.S. government between 1960 and 1972 have the potential to provide an important extension of the long-term record of Earth’s land surface. Recently declassiﬁed, the archive of images recorded by these satellites contains hundreds of thousands of photographs, many of which have very high ground resolution- 6–9 ft (1.8–2.7 m) even by today’s standards. This paper demonstrates methods for extending the span of forest-cover change analysis from the Landsat-5 and -7 era (1984 to present) to the previous era covered by the Corona archive in two study areas: one area covered predominantly by urban and sub-urban land uses in the eastern US and another area by tropical forest in central Brazil. We describe co-registration of Corona and Landsat images, extraction of texture features from Corona images, classiﬁcation of Corona and Landsat images, and post-classiﬁcation change detection based on the resulting thematic dataset. Second-order polynomial transformation of Corona images yielded geometric accuracy relative to Landsat-7 of 18.24 m for the urban area and 29.35 m for the tropical forest study area, generally deemed adequate for pixel-based change detection at Landsat resolution. Classiﬁcation accuracies were approximately 95\% and 96\% for forest/non-forest discrimination for the temperate urban and tropical forest study areas, respectively. Texture within 7 Â 7- to 9 Â 9-pixel (\$13.0–16.5 m) neighborhoods and within 11 Â 11-pixel (\$30 m) neighborhoods were the most informative metrics for forest classiﬁcation in Corona images in the temperate and tropical study areas, respectively. The trajectory of change from the 1960s to 2000s differed between the two study areas: the average annual forest loss rate in the urban area doubled from 0.68\% to 1.9\% from the 1960s to the mid-1980s and then decreased during the following decade. In contrast, deforestation in the Brazilian study area continued at a slightly increased pace between the 1960s and 1990s at annual loss rate of 0.62–0.79\% and quickly slowed down afterward. This study demonstrates the strong potential of declassiﬁed Corona images for detecting historical forest changes in these study regions and suggests increased utility for retrieving a wide range of land cover histories around the world.},

All estimates agree in the upward trend from 1850 to ∼1950 but not thereafter. In recent decades, when rates of land-use change and biomass density should be better known than in the past, the estimates are more variable. Most analyses have used three quasi-independent estimates of land-use change that are based on national and international agricultural and forestry data of limited accuracy in many countries. Further, the estimates of biomass used in the analyses have a common but limited literature base, which fails to address the spatial variability of biomass density within ecosystems. In contrast to the sources of information that have been used to date, a combination of existing ground and remote sensing data are available to determine with far higher accuracy rates of land-use change, aboveground biomass density, and, hence, the net ﬂux of carbon from land use and land-use change.},

	abstract = {Edge structure is one of the principal determinants of the extent and magnitude of edge effects in forest fragments. In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments.},

	title = {Dense labeling of large remote sensing imagery with convolutional neural networks: a simple and faster alternative to stitching output label maps},
	abstract = {In this work we consider the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-wise labeling (a.k.a., semantic segmentation) of remote sensing imagery (e.g., aerial color or hyperspectral imagery). Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as “tiles”, which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. As a result, during label inference, smaller sub-images, called “patches”, are processed individually and then “stitched” (concatenated) back together to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational inefficiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a conventional stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases. This approach contributed to our winning entry (overall performance) in the INRIA building labeling competition.},

	abstract = {Images from archival aerial photogrammetric surveys are a unique and relatively unexplored means to chronicle 3D land-cover changes over the past 100 years. They provide a relatively dense temporal sampling of the territories with very high spatial resolution. Such time series image analysis is a mandatory baseline for a large variety of long-term environmental monitoring studies. The current bottleneck for accurate comparison between epochs is their ﬁne georeferencing step. No fully automatic method has been proposed yet and existing studies are rather limited in terms of area and number of dates. State-of-the art shows that the major challenge is the identiﬁcation of ground references: cartographic coordinates and their position in the archival images. This task is manually performed, and extremely time-consuming. This paper proposes to use a photogrammetric approach, and states that the 3D information that can be computed is the key to full automation. Its original idea lies in a 2-step approach: (i) the computation of a coarse absolute image orientation; (ii) the use of the coarse Digital Surface Model (DSM) information for automatic absolute image orientation. It only relies on a recent orthoimage+DSM, used as master reference for all epochs. The coarse orthoimage, compared with such a reference, allows the identiﬁcation of dense ground references and the coarse DSM provides their position in the archival images. Results on two areas and 5 dates show that this method is compatible with long and dense archival aerial image series. Satisfactory planimetric and altimetric accuracies are reported, with variations depending on the ground sampling distance of the images and the location of the Ground Control Points.},

However, the general usefulness of deep learning applied to conventional photographic imagery at a landscape scale is, at yet, largely unproven. If DCNN-based image classiﬁcation is to gain wider application and acceptance within the geoscience community, demonstrable successes need to be coupled with accessible tools to retrain deep neural networks to discriminate landforms and land uses in landscape imagery. Here, we present an efﬁcient approach to train/apply DCNNs with/on sets of photographic images, using a powerful graphical method called a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF), to generate DCNN training and testing data using minimal manual supervision. We apply the method to several sets of images of natural landscapes, acquired from satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and ﬁxed camera installations. We synthesize our ﬁndings to examine the general effectiveness of transfer learning to landscape-scale image classiﬁcation. Finally, we show how DCNN predictions on small regions of images might be used in conjunction with a CRF for highly accurate pixel-level classiﬁcation of images.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests provide critical ecosystem services worldwide. Nonetheless, ongoing agricultural expansion, timber extraction, and mining continue to jeopardize important forest resources. In addition, many tropical forests reside in countries that have experienced violent conﬂict in recent decades, posing an additional, yet poorly understood threat. Conﬂict may decrease or increase deforestation depending on the relationship between conﬂict and other causes of land use change, such as mining expansion or protected area establishment. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), home of the second largest tropical forest in the world, has experienced 20 years of violent conﬂict, resulting in the death of over 100,000 combatants and up to 5 million civilians. Expanding mining concessions also threaten the DRC's forest, even though nearly 12\% of it is under some form of protection. In this study, we used spatially-explicit data on conﬂict, mining, and protected areas, along with a host of control variables, to estimate the impacts of these factors on forest cover loss from 1990 to 2010. Through a panel instrumental variables approach we found that: i) conﬂict increased forest cover loss, ii) mining concessions increased forest cover loss, but in times of conﬂict this impact was lessened, and iii) protected areas reduced forest cover loss, even in high conﬂict regions. Our results thus suggest that policy interventions designed to reduce violent conﬂict may have the co-beneﬁt of reducing deforestation, especially in areas with low mining potential. Likewise, protected areas can be effective even in times of war.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

However, habitat fragmentation and edge effects exposes vegetation to outside microclimatic conditions, thereby reducing the ability of the forest to buffer climatic variation. In this paper, we ask what proportion of forest in a fragmented ecosystem is impacted by altered microclimate conditions driven by edge effects, and extrapolate these results to the whole Atlantic Forest biome, one of the most disturbed biodiversity hotspots. To address these questions, we collected above and below ground temperature for a full year using temperature sensors placed in forest fragments of different sizes, and at different distances from the forest edge.},

To date most edge-effect research in Amazonia has concentrated on forests in relatively seasonal locations or with poor soils in the east of the basin. We present the first evaluation from the relatively richer soils of far western Amazonia on the extent to which mature forest biomass, diversity, and composition are affected by edges. In a southwestern Amazonian landscape we surveyed woody plant diversity, species composition, and biomass in 88 × 0.1 ha samples of unflooded forest that spanned a wide range in soil properties and included samples as close as 50 m and as distant as {\textgreater}10 km from anthropogenic edges. We applied Mantel tests, multiple regression on distance matrices, and other multivariate techniques to identify anthropogenic effects before and after accounting for soil factors and spatial autocorrelation. The distance to the nearest edge, access point, and the geographical center of the nearest community (“anthropogenic-distance effects”) all had no detectable effect on tree biomass or species diversity. Anthropogenic-distance effects on tree species composition were also below the limits of detection and were negligible in comparison with natural environmental and spatial factors. Analysis of the data set’s capacity to detect anthropogenic effects confirmed that the forests were not severely affected by edges, although because our study had few plots within 100 m of forest edges, our confidence in patterns in the immediate vicinity of edges is limited. It therefore appears that the conservation value of most “edge” forests in this region has not yet been compromised substantially. We caution that because this is one case study it should not be overinterpreted, but one explanation for our findings may be that western Amazonian tree species are naturally faster growing and more disturbance adapted than those farther east.},

	abstract = {Planting forests is an important practice for climate change mitigation, especially in the tropics where the carbon (C) sequestration potential is high. Successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge of the role of species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations. Despite this need, solid data on the long-term development of forest plantations are still very scarce. Monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77-year-old tree diversity experiment in Yangambi in the Congo basin were fully inventoried. We calculated above-ground C stocks using allometric equations, and soil C stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks. A high variability in aboveground C stocks across tree species combinations was observed. Apart from a species identity effect, the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area (BApl) and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon (AGC), with BApl being more important. Both AGC and BApl were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species; the planting of short-lived pioneers led to low AGC. We found no clear benefits, but also no drawbacks, for AGC of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including nitrogen fixing species in the plantation scheme. However, the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth. We conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks. This was predominantly caused by large differences in AGC sequestration over the past 77 years. Altogether, short-lived pioneer species had a low BApl resulting in low carbon sequestration, while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest AGC stocks. Tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the AGC stock, given that the appropriate functional type is planted.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},
